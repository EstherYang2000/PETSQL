### Your task: 
Answer the final question below by providing **only** the final SQLite SQL query syntax without commentary and explanation.  You must minimize SQL execution time while ensuring correctness.

    ### Sqlite SQL tables, with their properties:
#
# vehicle(Vehicle_ID, Model, Build_Year, Top_Speed, Power, Builder, Total_Production);
# driver(Driver_ID, Name, Citizenship, Racing_Series);
# vehicle_driver(Driver_ID, Vehicle_ID).
#
    # ### Here are some data information about database references.
    # #
# vehicle(Vehicle_ID[1,2,3],Model[AC4000,DJ ,DJ1],Build_Year[1996,2000,2000â€“2001],Top_Speed[120,200,120],Power[4000,4800,6400],Builder[Zhuzhou,Zhuzhou,Zhuzhou Siemens , Germany],Total_Production[1,2,20]);
# driver(Driver_ID[1,2,3],Name[Jeff Gordon,Jimmie Johnson,Tony Stewart],Citizenship[United States,United States,United States],Racing_Series[NASCAR,NASCAR,NASCAR]);
# vehicle_driver(Driver_ID[1,1,1],Vehicle_ID[1,3,5]);
#
### Foreign key information of Sqlite SQL tables, used for table joins: 
#
# vehicle_driver(Vehicle_ID) REFERENCES vehicle(Vehicle_ID);
# vehicle_driver(Driver_ID) REFERENCES driver(Driver_ID)
#
### Final Question: Return the names of drivers with citizenship from the United States.
